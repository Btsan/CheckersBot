American Checkers/English Draughts AI

---

A checkers playing agent that heuristically evaluates a given game state with a deep neural network.

The neural network model used is a multi-layer perceptron. The [demo AI](https://havorax.github.io/CheckersBot/) was initially trained with weakly supervised learning and further trained with reinforcement learning, by playing against itself.

## Room for Improvements

##### Look-Ahead
The checkers agent, after learning from 10,000 games against itself, performs badly by itself. This may be because it only learned to evaluate the immediate value of a game state and not the long-term value that also considers the opponent's actions.

This issue can be resolved by a look-ahead decision algorithm (such as the hardcoded MinMax algorithm in the [web demo](https://havorax.github.io/CheckersBot/)) but is time-consuming to calculate. A better solution would be to have the checkers agent train against a MinMax agent, so that it can learn to estimate the long-term MinMax value of game states. This erases the need to have the costly look-ahead algorithm, providng better run-time performance and AI gameplay level.

##### Convolutions
Another *possible* improvement is the usage of a convolutional neural network, instead of the multi-layer perceptron model. I had originally used an MLP, because the model considers the entire board state, without any loss of information. However, a MLP would have to learn the correct response to all possible game states, which are too many to consider. The number of game states also suggests a large number of weights and layers, than actually used in my application.

While I think a MLP model actually works quite well for checkers, and could possibly encode the good responses to all of game states it'd take very long to reach that level. A convolutional neural network would generalize the board state (AKA the loss of information I orignally feared) and train an agent to achieve a high gameplay level sooner than a MLP agent. 

## Tools Used

The model was implemented in [Keras](https://keras.io/), a deep learning library for Python.

The [web demo](https://havorax.github.io/CheckersBot/) uses [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) to run the Keras model.
