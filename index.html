			<h2>American Checkers</h2>
			<p>
				Also, known as English Draughts, this game features an 8x8 board, 24 total board pieces, and 4 types of pieces.
				Along with the rules, this means that there are <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/databases/checker_positions.html">500,995,484,682,338,672,639</a> legal game states. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Rules:</u>
				<ul>
					<li>Regular pieces can only move diagonally forward</li>
					<li>To capture, a piece <i>jumps</i> over an adjacent enemy piece</li>
					<li>If a capture can be made, it must be done</li>
					<li>Multiple captures can be performed in a single turn, but only with one piece</li>
					<li>King pieces can move both forward and backward</li>
					<li>Regular pieces are crowned Kings, if they reach the other side of the board</li>
					<li>A player loses by having all of their pieces captured or not moving during their turn</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				This AI game agent is a multi-layer perceptron (deep neural network) model. It was initially trained by a weakly supervised learning program, that generated <i>batches</i> of game states for the model to study. Afterwards the model was given to a reinforcement learning program, in which the model improved by playing against itself 100,000 times.
			</p>
			<p>
				<del>The AI demo above and reinforcement learning program do not use any sort of <i>look-ahead</i> algorithm, like <i>MinMax</i>. Otherwise, I fear my laptop would explode.</del>
				<del>The AI demo above <i>looks-ahead</i> 2 turns, using the <i>MinMax</i> decision algorithm.</del>
				No longer uses the simple, but slow, MinMax calculation. Instead, the MLP was retrained.
